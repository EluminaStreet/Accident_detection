This project focuses on detecting and analyzing vehicle crash damage using a deep learning pipeline. It leverages CNN architectures for image classification, damage severity estimation, and Grad-CAM for model interpretability. The implementation is done in PyTorch within a Jupyter Notebook.

üß† Features
Crash image classification using CNN (ResNet-based)

Severity percentage estimation for damage

Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability

Detailed report generation for input images

Ready for extension to video-based input streams
